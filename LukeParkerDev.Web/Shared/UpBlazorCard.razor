                🏦 I built this site to integrate with Up Bank (an Australian digital bank), to assist users with budgeting and to gain powerful future insights. It was built from my personal pain of doing budgetting in a spreadsheet when I knew there was a better way. There was no existing solution integrating with Up Bank, or that did exactly what I wanted... so I built this site!
